This is our time, to put our people back to work and open doors of opportunity for our kids; to 
restore prosperity and promote the cause of peace; to reclaim the American Dream and reaffirm that 
fundamental truth, that, out of many, we are one; that while we breathe, we hope. And where we are 
met with cynicism and doubts and those who tell us that we can't, we will respond with that timeless 
creed that sums up the spirit of a people: Yes, we can."
